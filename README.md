# CS569 - Web Application Development II
## Final Project 
### Furever Match Application specifications 
Build an application that will help pet lovers bring home a little furry friend:
* Breeders can post details about available new litters *(mom and dad breed, pet name, birthdate, breed, weight, picture, expected size, price)*. 
* Buyers should be able to browse litters by the nearest location to where they are, and send a request to the breeder and leave their contact details. 
* Breeders should be able to browse all adoption requests and contact the buyers. 

### Technical requirements
* Only authenticated users will be able to use the system. 
* Considering the nature of this application, you may consider having two different user roles: `Breeder` and `Buyer`.
* All `Get` requests should be paginated.
* Pets to be ordered by location and date (newest first).
* Buyers should be able to see how many requests placed on a specific pet.
* Once the breeder mark a pet as "adopted", it is displayed in a different color to indicate that the pet has a new home.

*This is not a group project, students should not work in groups or share code or copy code from any source. Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.*
